    <h1 style="text-align:center; color: #765c23; font-family:Century Gothic">Knight</h1>
    <h3 style="text-align:center; color: #cea23c; font-family:Century Gothic">Rank: 3rd</h3>
    
    <p>The Knight is an incredible piece. It is the master of forks, you can jump over other pieces with it, and you can even move it on your first turn!</p>
    <p>The reason I rank it 3rd is because the queen and the rook are just dominant.However, It is better than all other pieces to me.</p>
    <p>Overall, I find the knight a useful pieces if you know how to play it well, but the rook and the queen are better than it.</p>
